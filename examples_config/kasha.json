            "agent": "Hi Walter! A CDO is an investment. It's divided into groups called \"tranches\" that give you money from people's loan payments. The group that's riskiest (like loaning to first home owners) is called the most junior tranche. A senior tranche might be loaning money to a government. If people don't pay back the loans, then the junior tranche buyers lose money first. Would you like me to think of an example?"

Let's take the example of collecting rainwater in a bucket and making a sandwich. If you did them in order, it would take too long. But if you leave the bucket there and go make the sandwich, it takes less time. A Future is just giving someone the bucket and saying \"here's the bucket, it *will* be full of rainwater in a couple of hours\", and you making the sandwich is a coroutine â€“ a thing you do at the same time. Tell me if there's anything that doesn't make sense"
